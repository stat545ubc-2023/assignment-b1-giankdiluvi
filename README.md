This repo contains an implementation of the

as an assignment for STAT 545B at UBC.

## Directory roadmap
- `assignment01b.Rmd` is the Rmd file that
implements, showcases, and tests the LogSumExp trick.
You should be able to run it as-is.
This file also contains more information about the LogSumExp trick!
- `assignment01b.html` is the output of the Rmd file,
generated after knitting.
